# Project Zolee / Project: Demonder
Originally made in 2012, this small mod was created when I was extremely new to UDMF mapping (and also ZDoom mapping in general)
I always wanted to have a story-like mod for Doom, even way before I thought of making Mr. Smiley II

# Current status:
This mod isn't dead, just it's on hold for god knows how long until I finish Mr. Smiley II

- in 2016 changes were made to the fouth level to make it look more like demonic, but still left unfinished
- in 2017 many changes were made to the levels (map01 to map03) in order to make them look more decorated, and keep up with the dead town theme
- This version is newer than the ones you find on the ZDoom forum or moddb


# Levels:

- MAP01: Can be completed | Has skippable cutscenes
- MAP02: Can be completed | Has skippable cutscenes
- MAP03: Map is not finished | Has no cutscenes
- MAP04: Map is not finished | Has no cutscenes
