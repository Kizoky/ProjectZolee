# Project Zolee / Project: Demonder
Originally made in 2012, this small mod was created when I was extremely new to UDMF mapping (and also ZDoom mapping in general)
I always wanted to have a story-like mod for Doom, even way before I thought of making Mr. Smiley II

# Current status:
This mod isn't dead, just it's on hold for god knows how long until I finish Mr. Smiley II

# Levels:

- MAP01: Can be completed | Has skippable cutscenes
- MAP02: Can be completed | Has skippable cutscenes
- MAP03: Map is not finished | Has no cutscenes
- MAP04: Map is not finished | Has no cutscenes
